✅ Scenario 3: Deploy FusionDirector (for Huawei Cloud Shell)
✅ Goal
Simulate installing and launching FusionDirector using scripts, and create a data partition or directory to store logs and packages.

🧰 What You’ll Do in Huawei Cloud Shell
Task	Description
1	Create a simulated data partition (as Cloud Shell has no disk partitioning privileges).
2	Simulate autoDeploytool.sh script execution.
3	Check that microservices “start.”
4	Simulate logging into FusionDirector.

🔽 Step-by-Step Instructions
🔹 Step 1: Start Huawei Cloud Shell
Open Huawei Cloud Console

Log in.

Click the “Cloud Shell” icon at the top right.

Wait for the terminal to load.

✅ You are now in a Linux command-line environment.

🔹 Step 2: Update Your Cloud Shell Environment
Always start by updating your environment:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

🔹 Step 3: Create a Data Partition (Simulated)
FusionDirector needs a data partition of at least 100 GB. Since Cloud Shell doesn't allow actual disk partitioning, we simulate this with a folder:

mkdir ~/fusion_data


du -sh ~/fusion_data

4.0K    /home/HUAWEI_USER/fusion_data

 Step 4: Create the autoDeploytool.sh Script
FusionDirector uses a script to configure IPs and start services.

Open Nano editor:


nano autoDeploytool.sh


#!/bin/bash
echo "Step 1: Configuring network adapter IP addresses..."
sleep 2
echo "IP configuration done."

echo "Step 2: Preparing data disk..."
sleep 2
echo "Data disk mounted at ~/fusion_data"

echo "Step 3: Starting FusionDirector microservices..."
sleep 3
echo "✔️ All microservices started successfully!"

Save and exit:

Press Ctrl + O (to save)

Press Enter (to confirm)

Press Ctrl + X (to exit)

🔹 Step 5: Run the Script
Make the script executable:




chmod +x autoDeploytool.sh


Now run it:
./autoDeploytool.sh



You’ll see simulated output like:

Step 1: Configuring network adapter IP addresses...
IP configuration done.
Step 2: Preparing data disk...
Data disk mounted at ~/fusion_data
Step 3: Starting FusionDirector microservices...
✔️ All microservices started successfully!




🔹 Step 6: Simulate Accessing FusionDirector UI
Normally, you would access FusionDirector via a web browser using this format:


https://<IP>:port


echo "✅ FusionDirector is running. Access it via: https://192.168.1.100:port"


You’ve now:

Created a simulated data partition.

Executed the autoDeploytool.sh script.

Simulated FusionDirector startup.

Displayed the login address.

or
🔁 Repeat Scenario 3 with real disk commands for a real server environment (for practice)?
